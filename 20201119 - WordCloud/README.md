# Among Us Google Play Store Comments Word Cloud using Python
Hello Everyone! I kinda intrigued with analyzing the comments from our Among Us project (see “Our Projects Section” to sneak peek about our previous projects). As I haven't got the ability to do an advanced text analytics such as sentiment analysis, I started with a simple Word Cloud to gather a general overview of what people think about this game.

In case you missed it, in our previous project, we made some analysis from the Google Play Store User Ratings and Comments for Among Us Game. The data were scrapped from Google Play Store User Rating and Comments for Among Us Game with the range of September 22nd to October 20th.
